Building BTCU
================

See platform-specific instructions on building the various
elements of the Bitcoin Ultimate:
- [osx](doc/build-osx.md)
- [unix](doc/build-unix.md)
- [windows](doc/build-windows.md)

You can clean up all autogenerated files by running a command:
git clean -dfx

But please use it with cation since the command can wipe out all uncommited (untracked) files from the project.

Important Note:
If you need to install btcu-qt_*.deb on Ubuntu 20.04 you'll have to install libicu60 manually:

```bash
    wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/i/icu/libicu60_60.2-3ubuntu3.1_amd64.deb
    sudo apt-get --assume-yes --force-yes -y install ./libicu60_60.2-3ubuntu3.1_amd64.deb
```
